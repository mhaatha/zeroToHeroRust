main.rs:
- println! calls a Rust macro. That macros don't always follow the same rules as functions.
- println calls a normal function.
- don't forget semicolon(;) to end the line.
- Compiling & Running
- compiling = rustc <file to compile> || After compiling, Rust outputs a binary executable
- running = ./<file to run>
- Rust is an "ahead-of-time compiled" language. You can compile a program and give the executable to someone else and they can run it even without having Rust installed.

- To obtain user input and then print the result as output, we need to bring the io (input/output) library into scope. The io library comes from the standard library, known as std.
- By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it brings into the scope of every program. This set is called prelude.
- The prelude is the list of things that Rust automatically imports into every Rust program.
- String::new() -> a function that returns a new instance of a String.
- The :: syntax in the ::new line indicates that new is an associated function of the String type.
- An associated function is a function that's implemented on a type, in this case String.
- This new function creates a new, empty string.
- In full, the let mut guess = String::new(); line has created a mutable variable that is currently bound to a new, empty instance of a String.
- The full job of read_line is to take whatever the user types into standard input and append that into a string (without overwriting its contents).
- Enumeration is a type that can be in one of multiple possible states. We call each possible state a variant.
